# node-red-robot
A project to create a complete robot based entirely on node-red

# Summary
I love node-red... and robots. 
If, like me, you've built a raspberry pi based robot and happily followed all the insructions, installed all the libaries fired it up and low and behold it's done it's robot thing... but then thought, that's great but how on earth do I modifiy it to my bidding then this might be for you.
Picking apart the code, that is possibly in multiple languages and certainly in different libraries all over the place, running on different technologies can be pretty off-putting.

Robots are made up of many completely different parts, different interfaces, manufaturers, functions. Fortunately, the completely great node-red is perfect for getting different parts to talk to each other. If it was up to me I'd give it the prize for the greatest coding/making product of all time. I'm lucky enough to work in the same company as the creators.. never talked to them... and might be a bit star struck if I ever did, but hey!


This is of course a basic starter kit but I hope it will encourage others to build and create.

# Parts
(I do not recommend any particular supplier or product here)
* Raspberry Pi 3 (wifi enabled) and Memory Card (the faster the better as node-red does add some overhead processing)
* Wifi dongle if not using a wifi enabled Raspberry Pi
* Explorer pHat or Explorer Hat eg https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/explorer-phat
* Robot Chassis. Any bare chassis will do. eg https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/sts-pi
* Rasberry Pi Camera
* Ultrasonic Range Finder
* Cylindrical Mobile Phone Backup Rechargable Battery. eg https://www.amazon.co.uk/Anker-PowerCore-Aluminum-Portable-Lipstick-Sized/dp/B005QI1A8C/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&qid=1494517006&sr=8-11&keywords=mobile+phone+backup+battery
* Powered Speaker
* Usb Microphone 
* Short Usb Cable to connect Battery to Pi
